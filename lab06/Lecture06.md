## Standard Greeking

The Standard text used since the C16th is the Lorem Ipsum.
The key meaning is that the placeholder text looks like real text.
It has the same rhythms & cadences as real language, & hence real copy.

Word length & frequencies are similar so we can assume that text of certain length 9word count) will fit the are we've designed for.

This has been standard practice in publishing for many years. In this way, we know roughly hw may words an article will be but don't have the actual article yet.

## Colors

Colour can be re-used in multiple places - so aim to minimize the number of colours. A five colours basic palette is very common even for complex sites.

It could be useful use a palette building tool to design your palette. We select dominant or base colour for the scheme, the tool selects complimentary, monochromatic, triad, analogour, compound or shade based groups of colours for you from the colour wheel on the basis of colour theory.
