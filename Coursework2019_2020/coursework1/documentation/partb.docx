    Select in Materialize seems don't work. Searching online I foount out that they override the browser defaul select stile and ddor this is reason 
    the select is not shown. After make sure that the materialize.js file was in the correct path and included in my index.html file, 
    I have added the class "browser-defaul" to the select tag and it has been displayed immediately.
