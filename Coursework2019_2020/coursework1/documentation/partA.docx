PDF report, that is limited to no more than 8 pages of text (images do not
contribute towards the page limit) and which includes the following:

1. A description of the game that you are planning with enough background
context for your reader to understand what you are trying to do. If you have a
draft of your story or storyline then you should include it here.

2. A summary of any background research you have done with a description of how
this has contributed to your project (perhaps through better understanding of
potential solutions, libraries, or APIs that might assist you).

inclusion in your report.

6. As appropriate: any additional sections that you deem fit to describe your
project. For example, if you have decided to implement a particular feature as
an extension then this would be the place to report on it. Similarly if you intend
to save data within the browse, then some description of the kinds of data that
you intend to store, how you will store it, and how it will be structured, should
be reported on.

material to fit within the 8 page limit.
