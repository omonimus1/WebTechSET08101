            <h1>Pollicino</h1>
            <p>
                Now, it happened that after a while the woman had a child who was
                perfect in all his limbs, but no bigger than a thumb. Then the parents said, "He is just what we
                wished for, and we will love him very much," and they named him according to his stature, "Tom Thumb."
                And though they gave him plenty of nourishment, he grew no bigger, but remained exactly the same size as
                when he was first born; and he had very good faculties, and was very quick and prudent, so that all he did
                prospered.

                One day his father made ready to go into the forest to cut wood, and he said,
                as if to himself, "Now, I wish there was some one to bring the cart to meet me." -
                "O father," cried Tom Thumb, "I can bring the cart, let me alone for that, and in proper time, too!" Then the father laughed, and said,
                "How will you manage that? You are much too little to hold the reins." - "That has nothing to do with it, father;


                while my mother goes on with her spinning I will sit in the horse's ear and tell him where to go." -
                "Well," answered the father, "we will try it for once.
